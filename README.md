# Project Overview
My Wallet: Digital Wallet with Event Sourcing Integration

"My Wallet" is a digital wallet backend application developed using **NestJS** and **TypeScript**. Designed with simplicity in mind, it offers two core REST endpoints: one for saving a transaction and another to check the balance. This application integrates with EventStoreDB to implement the **event-sourcing** approach.

## Key Technologies & Concepts:
[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)  
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
[Event Sourcing](https://www.eventstore.com/event-sourcing#:~:text=Event%20Sourcing%20is%20an%20architectural,effective%20architecture%20for%20their%20needs.)  
[Event Store DB](https://www.eventstore.com/)  
[Redis (Not implemented yet)](https://redis.io/)  
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/)  
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Project Purpose:
"My Wallet" serves as a practical illustration of event sourcing within a digital wallet scenario. By integrating with EventStoreDB, it is aimed to demonstrate the strengths and potential of the event sourcing paradigm in financial domain applications, emphasizing its utility even in simpler systems like "My Wallet".
